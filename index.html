        <h2>About This Page</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the <strong>Computer Network Defense</strong> testing page for <em>Assessment 2</em>. This page is designed to host 
            <strong>Indicators of Compromise (IoC)</strong> files, which can be used by students to test their threat hunting scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IoC files uploaded here are part of a practical exercise. Feel free to download the files and run your scripts against them as part of your course requirements. If you are third year at 2024 Noroff, you know that your script should be run like ./script thiswebpage remoteserver identity
