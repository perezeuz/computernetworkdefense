        <p>
            Welcome to the <strong>Computer Network Defense</strong> testing page for <em>Assessment 2</em>. This page is designed to host 
            <strong>Indicators of Compromise (IoC)</strong> files, which can be used by students and professionals to test their threat hunting scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IoC files uploaded here are part of a practical exercise. Feel free to download the files and run your scripts against them as part of your course requirements.
